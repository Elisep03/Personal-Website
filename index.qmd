## About Me

Hi there! I'm Elise, a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a degree in statistics and data science. I'm passionate about turning **complex data into tangible results** and helping people understand more about elaborate concepts in a **clear and engaging way**.

My interests include hiking, traveling, cafe hopping, watching animated shows, and collecting all kinds of trinkets!
